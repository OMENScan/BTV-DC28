Turning Telemetry and Forensic Artifacts Into Information

Recommended Pre Installs:
Pre-Installation is not mandatory, but is recommended.  To get the most from this workshop several software tools should be pre-installed.  The workshop moves very quickly and pre-installation will help the participant to focus on the content rather than the installation(s).

1. All Utilities and Software will be run under Windows.  Some may work under other platforms but all examples in this workshop are geared towards Windows.  Specifically Windows 10.  I recommend either a Windows 10 machine or VM.

2. Highly Recommended: Participants should Pre-Install AChoir (Latest Version is 4.4)
